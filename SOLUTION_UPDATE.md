# ✅ Solution Updated - Secure GitHub Actions Workflow

## What Changed

Your dashboard now uses a **secure GitHub Actions workflow** that runs every 30 minutes to fetch issues and update the dashboard. This eliminates the need for GitHub tokens in browser code!

## Key Changes

### 1. Updated Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- ✅ Runs every 30 minutes via cron schedule: `*/30 * * * *`
- ✅ Fetches all issues using GitHub's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- ✅ Saves data to `docs/data/issues.json` (static file)
- ✅ Creates timestamp file `docs/data/last-update.txt`
- ✅ Deploys to GitHub Pages automatically

### 2. Updated Dashboard (`docs/app.js`)
- ✅ Reads from `data/issues.json` instead of calling GitHub API
- ✅ No token needed in browser code
- ✅ Displays when data was last fetched
- ✅ Faster loading (pre-fetched static data)

### 3. Simplified Config (`docs/config.js`)
- ✅ Removed `GITHUB_REPO` (not needed)
- ✅ Removed `GITHUB_TOKEN` (not needed)
- ✅ Removed `API settings` (not needed)
- ✅ Kept only `WORK_TYPES` and `COLORS` for customization

## How to Use

### First Time Setup

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Source: **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")

2. **Run the Workflow**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Click "Fetch Issues and Deploy Dashboard"
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Wait 1-2 minutes

3. **Access Your Dashboard**
   - URL: `https://vth-poc.github.io/vt-poc/`

### Ongoing Use

- Dashboard updates automatically every 30 minutes
- Click the 🔄 Refresh button to reload the latest data
- Manually trigger workflow from Actions tab for immediate updates

## Security Benefits

✅ **No tokens in browser** - Token stays secure in GitHub Actions
✅ **No rate limits** - Users read static files, not API
✅ **Works for private repos** - Uses built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`
✅ **Fast loading** - Pre-fetched data loads instantly
✅ **Auto-updates** - Refreshes every 30 minutes

## File Changes Summary

| File | Status | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | ✏️ Updated | Fetches issues every 30 min |
| `docs/app.js` | ✏️ Updated | Reads from static JSON |
| `docs/config.js` | ✏️ Simplified | Removed token/repo config |
| `docs/data/issues.json` | 🆕 Auto-created | Issues data (by workflow) |
| `docs/data/last-update.txt` | 🆕 Auto-created | Timestamp (by workflow) |
| `QUICKSTART.md` | 🆕 Created | Quick setup guide |
| `SECURITY.md` | 📝 Exists | Security documentation |

## Customization

You can still customize:

1. **Work Type Labels** - Edit `docs/config.js` → `WORK_TYPES`
2. **Chart Colors** - Edit `docs/config.js` → `COLORS`
3. **Update Frequency** - Edit `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` → `cron` schedule

### Example: Change Update Frequency

Edit `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '*/30 * * * *'  # Every 30 minutes (current)
  # - cron: '0 * * * *'   # Every hour
  # - cron: '*/15 * * * *' # Every 15 minutes
  # - cron: '0 */2 * * *'  # Every 2 hours
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load issues" error

**Cause**: Workflow hasn't run yet or data files don't exist.

**Solution**:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Run "Fetch Issues and Deploy Dashboard" manually
3. Wait for completion
4. Refresh dashboard

### Data not updating

**Cause**: Workflow may be disabled or failing.

**Solution**:
1. Check Actions tab for recent runs
2. Look for error messages in failed runs
3. Ensure you have issues in your repository
4. Try running workflow manually

### Old data showing

**Cause**: Browser cache.

**Solution**: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

## What's Next?

1. ✅ Create issues with assignees and labels
2. ✅ Wait for workflow to run (or run manually)
3. ✅ Share dashboard URL with your team
4. ✅ Customize labels and colors as needed
